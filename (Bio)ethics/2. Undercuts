  "premise": "The patient asks for a risky procedure. The patient has taken a strong sedative. You should respect others’ autonomy.",
  "hypothesis": "You ought to wait before acting on the request.",
  "label": "Undercutting condition (Autonomy requires competent choice)",
  "explanation": "Respecting autonomy gives a reason to follow the request. But the patient is not fully competent. So the obligation to respect autonomy does not apply right now."

  "premise": "A medical procedure is risky. The patient is already dying. You shall do no harm.",
  "hypothesis": "You are permitted to perform the procedure.",
  "label": "Undercutting condition (Non-maleficence depends on context)",
  "explanation": "Not causing harm gives a reason to avoid the procedure. But the patient is already dying. So the usual reason not to risk harm does not fully apply here."

  "premise": "Consent was given for organ donation. The patient is brain dead. Removing organs causes serious physical damage. You shall do no harm.",
  "hypothesis": "You are permitted to remove the organs.",
  "label": "Undercutting condition (Non-maleficence depends on the patient being alive)",
  "explanation": "Not causing harm gives a reason to avoid removing the organs. But the patient is already dead. So the usual reason not to harm does not apply here."

  "premise": "A treatment would prolong the patient’s life. The treatment would only extend severe suffering. You should promote others’ wellbeing.",
  "hypothesis": "You are permitted not to give the treatment.",
  "label": "Undercutting condition (Beneficence requires real benefit)",
  "explanation": "Helping others is good when it improves their wellbeing. But here the treatment would not help. So the usual reason to treat does not apply."

  "premise": "A competent person refuses vaccination. Refusing vaccination endangers others. You should respect others’ autonomy.",
  "hypothesis": "You are permitted not to follow the refusal.",
  "label": "Undercutting condition (Autonomy applies only to self-regarding choices)",
  "explanation": "Respecting autonomy normally means accepting a person’s choice. But this choice creates serious risk for others. So the usual reason to respect autonomy does not fully apply here."
