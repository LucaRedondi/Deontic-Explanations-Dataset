    "premise": "The patient asks for a risky procedure. The patient has taken a strong sedative. You should respect others’ autonomy.",
    "hypothesis": "You ought to wait before acting on the request.",
    "label": "Undercut",
    "explanation": "A request typically indicates a competent expression of will. Given that you should respect others’ autonomy, a competent expression of will is a reason to follow the request. But the patient is sedated and not competent. So autonomy does not generate a reason to follow the request here."

    "premise": "The patient is brain dead. Removing organs causes serious physical damage. You shall do no harm.",
    "hypothesis": "You are permitted to remove the organs.",
    "label": "Undercut",
    "explanation": "Causing physical damage typically indicates harming a patient. Given that you shall do no harm, harming a patient is a reason against removing organs. But the patient is brain dead and no longer a subject of harm. So the principle does not generate a reason against removing the organs here."

    "premise": "A treatment would prolong the patient’s life. The treatment would only extend severe suffering. You should promote others’ wellbeing.",
    "hypothesis": "You are permitted not to give the treatment.",
    "label": "Undercut",
    "explanation": "Prolonging life typically indicates a benefit. Given that you should promote others’ wellbeing, a genuine benefit is a reason to offer the treatment. But here the treatment brings no benefit and only extends suffering. So the principle does not generate a reason to give the treatment."
