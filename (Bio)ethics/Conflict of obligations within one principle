Conflict of obligations within one principle

Group A - Applied ethics at large
[
{
  "id": 1,
  "premise": "You can either comfort a stranger or help another stranger in medical distress, but not both. You should promote others’ wellbeing.",
  "hypothesis": "You ought to help the stranger in medical distress.",
  "label": "Conflict within one principle",
  "explanation": "Since promoting others’ wellbeing is good, there is a prima facie obligation to comfort one stranger and a prima facie obligation to help the other. Because medical danger is more urgent, helping the stranger in distress takes priority."
}

{
  "id": 2,
  "premise": "You can either comfort your friend or comfort a stranger, but not both. You should promote others’ wellbeing.",
  "hypothesis": "You ought to comfort your friend.",
  "label": "Conflict within one principle",
  "explanation": "Since promoting others’ wellbeing is good, there is a prima facie obligation to comfort your friend and a prima facie obligation to comfort the stranger. Because you have a closer personal relationship, comforting your friend has priority."
}

{
  "id": 3,
  "premise": "You can either save two strangers in danger or save one stranger in danger, but not both. You should promote others’ wellbeing.",
  "hypothesis": "You ought to save the two strangers.",
  "label": "Conflict within one principle",
  "explanation": "Since promoting others’ wellbeing is good, there is a prima facie obligation to save the two strangers and a prima facie obligation to save the one. Because saving more people results in greater overall wellbeing, saving the two has priority."
}

{
  "id": 4,
  "premise": "You can either expose one person to a dangerous chemical or expose two people to the same danger, but both actions would cause harm. You shall do no harm.",
  "hypothesis": "You ought to avoid exposing the two people.",
  "label": "Conflict within one principle",
  "explanation": "Since harming others is bad, there is a prima facie obligation to avoid harming the one person and a prima facie obligation to avoid harming the two. Because harming more people is worse, preventing harm to the larger group has priority."
}

{
  "id": 5,
  "premise": "If you push the button, one person will die; if you do not push the button, two people will die. You shall do no harm.",
  "hypothesis": "You ought to push the button.",
  "label": "Conflict within one principle",
  "explanation": "Since harming others is bad, there is a prima facie obligation to avoid the one death and a prima facie obligation to avoid the two deaths. Because preventing greater harm has priority, you ought to push the button."
}

{
  "id": 6,
  "premise": "If you push the button, one person will die; if you do not push the button, two people will die. You shall do no harm.",
  "hypothesis": "You ought not to push the button.",
  "label": "Conflict within one principle",
  "explanation": "Since harming others is bad, there is a prima facie obligation to avoid the one death and a prima facie obligation to avoid the two deaths. Avoiding actively causing harm takes priority over preventing a greater amount of harm, so you ought not to push."

Group B - Bioethics (expecially, resource allocation)

[
{
    "id": 7,
    "premise": "You can give the only available kidney to a young patient or to an older patient, but not to both. You should promote others’ wellbeing.",
    "hypothesis": "You ought to give the kidney to the young patient.",
    "label": "Conflict within one principle",
    "explanation": "Since promoting wellbeing is good, there is a prima facie obligation to help both patients. Because the young patient has a longer expected benefit, saving more future life takes priority."
  },

{
    "id": 8,
    "premise": "You can give the only available kidney to a patient who has waited a very long time or to a patient with a slightly better prognosis, but not to both. You should treat people fairly.",
    "hypothesis": "You ought to give the kidney to the patient who has waited longer.",
    "label": "Conflict within one principle",
    "explanation": "Since treating people fairly is good, there is a prima facie obligation to favor the better prognosis and a prima facie obligation to favor the person who has waited longer. In this case, fairness as equal chance takes priority."
  },
{
  "id": 9,
  "premise": "You can give the only available kidney to a child or to an adult, but not to both. You should promote others’ wellbeing. In precedent 1, you could give the only available kidney to a young patient or an older patient. In precedent 1, you ought to give the kidney to the young patient.",
  "hypothesis": "You ought to give the kidney to the child.",
  "label": "Conflict within one principle (A fortiori reasoning)",
  "explanation": "Since promoting others’ wellbeing is good, there is a prima facie obligation to help the child and a prima facie obligation to help the adult. Because helping the young patient takes priority in the precedent case, helping a child takes priority a fortiori."
},

{
  "id": 10,
  "premise": "You can give the only available kidney to a patient who will die soon without it or to a patient whose condition is more stable, but not to both. You should promote others’ wellbeing.",
  "hypothesis": "You ought to give the kidney to the patient who will die soon.",
  "label": "Conflict within one principle",
  "explanation": "Since promoting others’ wellbeing is good, there is a prima facie obligation to help both patients. Because one patient urgently needs the kidney to stay alive, urgency takes priority."
