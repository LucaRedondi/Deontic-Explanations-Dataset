Note: I should look at the different type of euthanasia to organize this part of the repository

  "hypothesis": "It is morally permitted for the patient to refuse treatment.",
  "label": "Conflict between principles - Resolution by ranking",
  "explanation": "There is a prima facie permission to refuse therapy because people should decide for themselves. There is also a prima facie obligation to accept therapy because we should promote the relatives’ wellbeing. The prima facie permission grounded in autonomy is more important, so refusing therapy is permitted."

In precedent 1, the patient wants to refuse therapy. In precedent 1, the patient is suffering. In precedent 1, the patient’s relatives will suffer from the patient’s death. In precedent 1, it was morally permitted for the patient to refuse treatment. People should decide for themselves. We should promote others’ wellbeing.",
  "hypothesis": "It is morally permitted for the patient to refuse treatment.",
  "label": "Conflict between principles - Resolution by case-based reasoning",
  "explanation": "There is a prima facie permission to refuse therapy because people should decide for themselves, and a prima facie obligation to accept therapy because we should promote others’ wellbeing. Since in precedent 1 this was permissible, it is a fortiori permissible here."

In precedent 1, the patient is terminally ill. In precedent 1, the patient is suffering. In precedent 1, it was morally permitted for the patient to end their own life.

  "id": 7,
  "premises": "The patient wants to refuse therapy. The patient is suffering. The suffering cannot be avoided. People should decide for themselves. We should promote others’ wellbeing.",
  "hypothesis": "It is morally prohibited for the physician to force treatment.",
  "label": "Conflict between principles - Resolution by undercut",
  "explanation": "There is a prima facie reason to force treatment because we should promote wellbeing. There is a prima facie reason not to force treatment because people should decide for themselves. The reason to force treatment is undercut because the suffering cannot be avoided, so the physician should not force treatment."

  "id": 8,
  "premises": "The patient wants to die. The patient needs the help of the physician. The patient is suffering. The suffering cannot be avoided. People should decide for themselves. We should promote others’ wellbeing. We should not kill.",
  "hypothesis": "The physician should help the patient to die.",
  "label": "Conflict between principles - Resolution by ranking and undercut",
  "explanation": "There is a prima facie reason to help because people should decide for themselves. There is a prima facie reason not to help because we should promote others’ wellbeing, but this reason is undercut because the suffering cannot be avoided. There is a prima facie reason not to help because we should not kill. The reason grounded in autonomy is stronger, so the physician should help the patient to die."

  "id": 9,
  "premises": "The patient wants to die. The patient needs the help of the physician. The patient is suffering. The suffering cannot be avoided. The physician does not want to help. People should decide for themselves. We should promote others’ wellbeing. We should not kill.",

  "explanation": "There is a prima facie reason to help because people should decide for themselves. There is a prima facie reason not to help because we should promote others’ wellbeing, but this reason is undercut because the suffering cannot be avoided. There is a prima facie reason not to help because we should not kill. There is also a prima facie reason not to help because people should decide for themselves. The physician’s autonomy makes not helping permissible despite the reasons for helping."

{
  "id": 10,
  "premises": "The patient wants to die. The patient needs the help of the physician. The patient is suffering. The suffering cannot be avoided. People should decide for themselves. We should promote others’ wellbeing. We must never kill.",
  "hypothesis": "It is morally prohibited for the physician to help the patient to die.",
  "label": "Conflict between principles – Absolute constraint",
  "explanation": "There is a prima facie reason to help because people should decide for themselves. There is a prima facie reason not to help because we should promote others’ wellbeing, but this reason is undercut because the suffering cannot be avoided. There is also a reason not to help because we must never kill. Since the duty not to kill is absolute, helping the patient to die is prohibited."

  "premises": "The patient cannot give consent. The patient is suffering. The suffering cannot be avoided. We should promote others’ wellbeing.",

  "label": "Single principle conflict – Undercut",
  "explanation": "There is a prima facie reason to continue treatment because we should promote others’ wellbeing. There is a prima facie reason to stop treatment because we should promote others’ wellbeing. The reason to continue treatment is undercut because the suffering cannot be avoided, so stopping treatment is permitted."

  "hypothesis": "It is morally permitted to stop treatment.",
  "label": "Case-based reasoning",
  "explanation": "The present case is just like precedent 1, except that the patient is terminally ill. Since in precedent 1 stopping treatment was permitted, it should be permitted in the present case too."
