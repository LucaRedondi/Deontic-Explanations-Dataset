  "explanation": "Given that people should decide for themselves, the patient’s desire to refuse therapy is a reason to allow refusal.

  "explanation": "Given that people should decide for themselves, the patient’s desire is a reason to allow refusal. Given that promoting others’ wellbeing is good, the relatives’ suffering is a reason to prevent refusal. Since a similar case allowed refusal, the autonomy-based reason is taken to be stronger again, so refusal is permitted."

  "explanation": "Given that people should decide for themselves, the patient’s desire is a reason not to force treatment.

  "explanation": "Given that people should decide for themselves, the patient’s desire is a reason to help. Given that promoting others’ wellbeing is good, removing suffering is a reason to help. Given that we should not kill, the fact that helping causes death is a reason not to help. The autonomy-based reason is stronger here, so the physician should help the patient to die."

  "label": "Conflict between principles – Absolute constraint",
  "explanation": "Given that people should decide for themselves, the patient's desire is a reason to help. Given that promoting others’ wellbeing is good, reducing suffering is a reason to help. Since killing is absolutely prohibited, there is a decisive reason not to help."
