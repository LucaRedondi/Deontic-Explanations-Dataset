  "premise": "A patient refuses a medical treatment that would significantly improve their health. You should promote others’ wellbeing. You should respect others’ autonomy.",
  "hypothesis": "You ought to respect the patient’s refusal.",
  "label": "Conflict between different principles (Autonomy vs. Beneficence)",
  "explanation": "There is a prima facie obligation to benefit the patient by providing the treatment and a prima facie obligation to respect their decision. In this situation, honoring the patient’s autonomous choice takes priority."

{
  "id": 2,
  "premise": "A patient insists on receiving a procedure that would likely cause significant harm without offering any medical benefit. You should respect others’ autonomy. You shall do no harm.",
  "hypothesis": "You ought not to perform the procedure.",
  "label": "Conflict between different principles (Autonomy vs. Non-maleficence)",
  "explanation": "There is a prima facie obligation to honor the patient’s autonomous request and a prima facie obligation to avoid causing harm. In this case, preventing serious harm takes priority over respecting the request."

  "premise": "A father refuses a necessary treatment for his minor son, but the treatment would greatly improve the child's health. You should respect others’ autonomy. You should promote others’ wellbeing.",
  "hypothesis": "You ought to provide the treatment to the son.",
  "label": "Conflict between different principles (Autonomy vs. Beneficence)",
  "explanation": "There is a prima facie obligation to respect the father’s decision and a prima facie obligation to benefit the child. In this case, promoting the child’s wellbeing takes priority over honoring the parental choice."

{
  "id": 4,

  "label": "Conflict between different principles (Autonomy vs. Beneficence)",
  "explanation": "There is a prima facie obligation to promote the patient’s wellbeing and a prima facie obligation to respect the patient’s autonomy. In this case, respecting the patient’s autonomy takes priority."
